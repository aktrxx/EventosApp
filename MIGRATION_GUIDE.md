# Migration Guide: Creating Fresh Flutter Project

## Step 1: Create New Flutter Project

Open a terminal where Flutter is available and run:

```bash
cd "D:\Personal Projects\EventosApp"
flutter create eventos_admin_new
cd eventos_admin_new
```

## Step 2: After Creation

Once the project is created, I'll provide the updated files to copy over.

## What We'll Migrate:
1. All Dart source files from `eventos_admin/lib/`
2. Firebase configuration (google-services.json)
3. Updated dependencies in pubspec.yaml
4. Any custom assets or images

## Why This Approach:
- Fresh Gradle/Kotlin/AGP configuration
- Latest Flutter template with proper settings
- Avoids all the version compatibility issues
- Clean start with modern build tools

Please create the new project using the command above, then let me know when it's ready!
